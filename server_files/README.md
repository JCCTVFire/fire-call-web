## Description
Base directory for the backend application. All files for the backend application go here.

## Config
During development, be sure to change the contents of `./server_files/database/config.js` to be a user in your locally hosted database. Do not modify the values for `production`. 

**WARNING**: _Do not use the root user for making api calls, as this could cause irreparable damage to your database._

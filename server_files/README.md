## Description
Base directory for the backend application. All files for the backend application go here.

## Config
During development, be sure to change the contents of `./database/config.js` to be a user in your locally hosted databas. Do not modify the  values for `production`. _Do not use the root user, as this could cause irreparable damage to your database._
